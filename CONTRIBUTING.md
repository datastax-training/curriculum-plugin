To contribute to this project, please use the following workflow:

1. Fork this project.
2. In your fork, create a branch with a name that is at least somewhat related to the work you're doing.
3. Write your code. We do not insist on 100% test coverage for every change, but try not to make coverage any worse.
4. Make sure all existing tests still pass.
5. Open a pull request against the parent project. Describe your change in as much detail as possible.
6. Collaborate with the super cool people who maintain the plugin. Ideally this ends in having your PR merged!

If your change is highly consequential, you might try opening an issue in the parent repo first to discuss it first.

Thank you for contributing! We appreciate every single line of code.
