== Contributing Code

== Important notes

Please don't edit files in the `dist` subdirectory as they are generated via https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp[gulp].
You'll find source code in the `lib` subdirectory.

=== Code style

Regarding code style like indentation and whitespace, **follow the conventions you see used in the source already.**

== Modifying the code

First, ensure that you have the latest http://nodejs.org/[Node.js] and http://npmjs.org/[npm] installed.

Test that gulp is installed globally by running `gulp --version` at the command-line.
If gulp isn't installed globally, run `npm install -g gulp` to install the latest version.

. Fork and clone the repo.
. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies (including gulp).
. Run `gulp` to build this project.

Assuming that you don't see any red, you're ready to go.
Just be sure to run `gulp` after making any changes, to ensure that nothing is broken.

== Submitting pull requests

. Create a new branch, please don't work in your `master` branch directly.
. Add failing tests for the change you want to make.
  Run `gulp` to see the tests fail.
. Fix stuff.
. Run `gulp` to see if the tests pass.
  Repeat steps 2-4 until done.
. Update the documentation to reflect any changes.
. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
