== Regular Token Range Assignment
[#drawing]

*Token assignment is not always an even spread*

[.cue]
****
In a perfect world, we would not have to decomission/recommision nodes. But, we are not in a perfect world and adding/removing nodes to your cluster is common. That said, with normal token range assignments, you have to ensure that your token assignments are evenly spread. Adding/removing nodes to your cluster can also make the system unbalanced for a time, and it also requires nodes with existing data to stream the data to the new node(s).

For example, here is an unbalanced cluster. Notice the yellow node owns half of the token range.

Animation 1: Here we see smaller circles representing partitions. A good partitioner evenly spreads the partition token assignments. The yellow node has double the number of partitions as the other two nodes.

Animation 2: We wish to add a new node to the cluster.

Animation 3: Ideally the new node splits the yellow node's token range assignment in half.

Animation 4: Notice the new node does just that.

Animation 5: Notice half the partitions in the yellow node fall into this light-blue token range, and thus Cassandra must now move them to the new node.

Animation 6: The yellow node streams the pertinent replicas to the new nodes. Unfortunately this puts strain on the yellow node.

== VNodes

[#vndes]

*Each node has several tokens it manages*

[.cue]

Cassandra's vnode feature helps mitigate this problem by having each physical node act more like several smaller virtual nodes. Let's examine how this works.

Animation 1: Each node is now responsible for several smaller slices of the ring instead of just one large slice.

Animation 2: Notice, with a consistent hash, all three nodes have roughly the same amount of data. That's because each node's smaller portions of the ring add up to one-third of the ring instead of one-half plus two one-fourth sections as we saw in the previous slide. This isn't such a big win so far however because in the previous example with just three nodes, we could have split our range into even thirds instead.

Animation 3: One of the real wins with vnodes, however, is when a node wants to join or leave this cluster. Here the blue node wants to join the cluster as it did on the previous slide.

Animation 4: Notice the token assignments again change, however, instead of the new node simply taking over one node's token range, the new node takes over portions of every node's range.

Animation 5: Notice our partition colors for the blue node change to blue themselves. Now every node has some data that it must stream to the new node.

Animation 6: Each node streams its data in parallel with the other nodes. This makes bootstrapping a new node into the cluster take much less time and takes the burden of doing this streaming off any single node.

== VNode Details

* Adding/removing nodes with vnodes should not make the cluster unbalanced
* By default, each node has 256 vnodes
* VNodes automate token range assignment

== Configuration

* Configure vnode settings in cassandra.yaml
* num_tokens
* Value greater than one turns on vnodes
